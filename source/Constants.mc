// dictionary entry PER CHUNK in a single Storage value ({ "itemId:idx" =>
// 9-field dict }), and a long audiobook (The Algebraist: 19.4h = 389 chunks)
// made that value large enough that Storage.setValue() died with a FATAL,
// UNCATCHABLE "Out Of Memory Error" - reproduced in the simulator against
// this exact device profile (fenix8solar51mm), which gives an
// audioContentProvider app only 512KB. On the watch that crash surfaces as
// the native "Media Error Occurred" dialog + app exit. Storage values are
// also hard-limited to 32KB each (SDK-documented). So: everything below is
// O(books), never O(chunks) - chunk boundaries are DERIVED via the Chunks
// module, and per-chunk refIds live in one small per-book value.
